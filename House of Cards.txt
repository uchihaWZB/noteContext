   truth.My God!All I ever amounted to is chitterlings.

	我都快不忍心了，他也不想做我的盘中肉，等我把他剁碎了喂狗，他才会承认那残忍的不可避免的真相，上帝啊！原来我不过是一盘猪肠。

   faith.

10、Did you smell that?The smugness?The false deference.She thinks I can be bought with a pair of tickets.What am I a whore in post-war Berlin salivating over
	free stocking and chocolate?What she's asking will cost far more than that.
	
	你闻到了吗？装模作样，假装顺从。她以为两张票就能收买我，我是个战后柏林的妓女吗？眼馋那点免费长袜和巧克力？她想要的东西，代价要高得多。
	
11、help me,help you

	与我方便，与你方便
	
12、Forward!That is the battle cry.Leave ideologies for the Armchair General does me no good.

	勇往直前！这是我的作战口号。纸上谈兵那一套于我无益。
	
13、Power's a lot like real estate.It's all about location,location,location.The closer you are to the source,the higher your property value.

	这个城市的每个人都在精心的改头换面，而弗莱迪的可贵之处就是他甚至不装作要改变。
	
16、Such a waste of talent.He chose money over power.In this town,a mistake nearly everyone makes.Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart
	after ten years.Power is the old stone building that stands for centuries.I can not respect someone who doesn't see the difference.
	
	真是浪费啊，为了钱而放弃权力。这个城市里几乎人人都犯了这个错。金钱是萨拉索塔的巨无霸豪宅，保质期也就只有十年。而权力是古老的石切建筑，能屹立数百年。
	我要怎么尊重连这都不懂的人。

18、I grew up here,in the up country.Bibles,barbecues,and broken backs.Everything gets just a little bit thicker this far south.The air,the blood,even me.I try
	to make it down here at least once a month.Every trip is a reminder of how far I've come.I hated Gaffney as a kid,when I had nothing,but now I've come to
	appreciate it.It's not as suffocating as it once was,except when I have to deal with the sort of nonsense that makes me want to hang myself.
	
	我在这个小乡村长大，《圣经》、烧烤、沉重的负担，这么靠南的地方，一切都更加浓郁，空气、血液、甚至我自己。我尽量每个月过来一次，每次来都会提醒我走了多远。
	小时候我讨厌加夫尼，那时我一无所有。但现在我能够欣赏它，它不像从前那样压抑难耐了，除了我要来处理这种让我想悬梁自尽的屁事的时候。
	
19、What are we supposed to do in the face of so much senseless pain?What else can we do but take what seems meaningless and try to make something meaningful
	from it.
	
	在这些无意义的痛苦面前，我们该怎么做？除了从无意义的事中尽力挖掘出一些有意义的东西，我们还能做什么呢？

	and if you can humble youself before them,they will do anything you ask.
	
	你要知道我的老乡们都是高尚的人，他们的自豪表现在谦逊中，这是他们的力量，也是他们的缺陷。如果你能在他们面前保持谦卑，他们会任你差遣。

	hypocrisy hurt.

25、Frends make the worst enemies.

26、If you do decide to take the coward's way out,cut along the tracks,not across them.That's a rookie mistake.

	如果你真决定以懦弱的方式解脱，沿血管割，不要横着割，这是低级错误。
	
27、Not an easy thing to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.

	对自由世界最有权势的人说不可不容易，但有些时候，要想赢得上司的尊重就只能违抗他。

29、You know what Francis said to me when he proposed?I remember his exact words.He said,"Claire,if all you want is happiness,Say no.I'm not gonna give you a
	couple of kids and count the days until retirement.I promise you freedom from that.I promise you'll never be bored."You know,he was the only man and there
	were a lot of others who proposed.But he was the only one who understood me.He didn't put me on some pedestal.He knew that I didn't want to be adored or
	coddled.So he took my hand and he put a ring on it.Because he knew I'd say yes.He's a man who knows how to take what he wants.
	
	你知道弗兰西斯向我求婚时说了什么吗？他说的每个字我都记得，他说，“克莱尔，如果你只想要幸福，那就拒绝吧。我不会跟你生一堆孩子然后数着日子退休。我保证你免受
	这些痛苦，也永远不会无聊。”虽然有很多人向我求婚，但他是唯一一个懂我的，他没把我看作什么女神，也知道我不想被崇拜或者溺爱，于是他拉起了我的手，为我戴上了戒指，
	因为他知道我会答应的。他懂得如何获得他想要的东西。
	
30、I'Doug,and I'm an alcoholic.One of the things I do for a living is count.I count votes.Yeas,nays,neutrals,abstaining.And I'm good at it.But the most important
	count I do has nothing to do with work.It's the number of days since April 4,1999.As of this morning,that's 5,185.The bigger that number gets,the more it
	frightens me,because I know all it takes is one drink to go back to zero.Most people see fear as a weakness.It can be.Sometimes for my job,I have to put fear
	in other people.I know that's not right.But if I'm honest,like the fourth step asks us to be,I have to be ruthless,because failure is not an option.The same
	goes for my sobriety.I have to use my fear.It makes me stronger.Like everyone in this room,I can't control who I am.But I can control the zero.Fuck the zero.
	
	我是道格，我是个酒鬼。我工作的一部分就是数数，同意票，反对票，中立票，弃权票。而且我很熟练。不过对我最重要的数字跟工作无关，而是从1999年4月4日至今的天数，截止
	今早，一共有5185天。数字越大，我越感到害怕。因为我知道一杯酒就能让数字清零。很多人认为恐惧是弱点，有时是的。有时由于工作的关系，我要让他人生惧，我知道那样不对，
	但如果按第四步说的那样，实话实说...我必须残忍，因为我不能失败，戒酒也是如此，我要对自己残忍，我得利用恐惧，它让我变得坚强。就像在座各位，我无法改变本性，但我
	能掌控那个零，让那个零去死吧。
	
31、Telling him everything but the truth.There's a value in having secrets.Creatures like myself,like Claire,like Zoe...we wouldn't be ourselves without them
	After all,we are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal.
	
	告诉他一切，唯独不说真话。保守秘密是有价值的。像我，像克莱尔，像佐伊这样的人，没有秘密，我们就不是自己。终究来说，我们多少只是我们选择表现出来的样子。
